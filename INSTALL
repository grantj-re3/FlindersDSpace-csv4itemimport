  server, but it is probably more convenient if you do.


2.3 INSTRUCTIONS

- Download from github
- Checkout latest version/tag if applicable
- Update config for your site, in particular:
  * constants at the head of bin/csv4itemimport.rb
  * constants at the head of lib/item.rb
  * rows within etc/itemsCharTest1.csv
  * CSV cleanup config at etc/conf/dublin_core_value_cleanup.yaml
  * ensure directory etc/files is populated with files/bitstreams
    specified within etc/itemsCharTest1.csv


3. EXAMPLES


3.1 SAMPLE INSTALLATION

The purpose of this sample is to:
- show how to install and configure this application
- show an example CSV file
- show how to import the resulting structure into DSpace


Scenario:

- You have a test environment to experiment with this app.
- Before importing into DSpace, you have crated a test-collection to
  import all the items into.
- You are happy with the CSV cleanup performed by using the config file...
- This application to be installed in $HOME/opt/csv4itemimport of an unprivileged user.
- This application will be installed on the same host as DSpace ??????????? not needed ??????????????


Instructions:

mkdir ~/opt
git clone https://github.com/grantj-re3/FlindersDSpace-csv4itemimport.git ~/opt/csv4itemimport
cd ~/opt/csv4itemimport

# If you want a particular version
git tag # List tagged releases
git checkout ... # Checkout the desired release

# Read files INSTALL LICENSE README*


# Update config for your site

In bin/csv4itemimport.rb, confirm the following variables have the values below:

  CONFIG_DIR = "../etc"
  CSV_PATH             = "#{CONFIG_DIR}/itemsCharTest1.csv"
  BITSTREAM_SOURCE_DIR = "#{CONFIG_DIR}/files"
  CLEANUP_CONFIG_PATH  = "#{CONFIG_DIR}/conf/dublin_core_value_cleanup.yaml"
  SAF_DEST_FOLDER = '../results/to_import'

In lib/item.rb, confirm the following variables have the values below:

  VALUE_DELIMITER = /\|\|/


In etc/itemsCharTest1.csv, confirm:
- the first line contains CSV column headings
- each other line contains information for a single DSpace-item corresponding to those column headings
- if any column needs more than a single value for that column, the values are separated by "||"

In etc/conf/dublin_core_value_cleanup.yaml, confirm:
- cleanup_mode is set to fromLookup_toLookupString
- the lookup table consists of byte values (integers in the range 0-255 or 0x00-0xff) and corresponding replacement strings suitable for "cleaning" your CSV data

In directory etc/files, confirm that all files specified in the dspace.files column of etc/itemsCharTest1.csv are present.


# Run the program
  bin/csv4itemimport_wrap.sh

Examine the results:
- Check for errors or issues displayed by the program output.
- If there are no errors or issues, check that the directory results/to_import has been created.
- Confirm that results/to_import is populated by directories and files which conform with the DSpace Simple Archive Format (SAF).
- If all looks good:
  * copy the "to_import" structure created to the DSpace test server (if you ran csv4itemimport_wrap.sh on another host)
  * run the DSpace SAF import in test-mode. Eg.
      /path/to/dspace import -a -s OUT_DIR -c COLLECTION_ID -m NEW_MAP_FILE -e USER_EMAIL --test
    where
      OUT_DIR = the "to_import" structure created by bin/csv4itemimport_wrap.sh
      and other options are defined in the DSpace manual
  * if the test-mode run was successful, perform a real import by omitting the "--test" option
- Celebrate!
