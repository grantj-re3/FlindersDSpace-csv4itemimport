# Valid lookup table information is given below.
#
# In the 'lookup' table/hash below:
# - byte values are specified on the left (indented from the 'lookup' column)
#   immediately followed by colon ":"
# - immediately followed by a space followed by the corresponding replacement
#   string (if 'fromLookup_toLookupString' was specified)
#
#
# If cleanup_mode is 'fromAbove7f_toHtmlUnicode' or 'none':
# - The table below is not used (and will be ignored). Hence, you can delete
#   all lines below, or comment them out or leave them unchanged.
#
# If cleanup_mode is 'fromLookup_toHtmlUnicode':
# - The integer (byte) keys are used as keys to lookup which characters shall
#   be replaced.
# - They must be immediately followed by a colon ":" but the string values to
#   the right side are ignored (so can be left empty or can be populated with
#   ~ [nil] or some arbitrary string).
#
# If cleanup_mode is 'fromLookup_toLookupString':
# - The integer (byte) keys are used as keys to lookup which characters shall
#   be replaced.
# - The string values to the right side shall be used to replace the associated
#   (byte) key.
