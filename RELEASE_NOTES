=============================

Release Notes
-------------

v0.1
----
Initial version. Is able to "clean" CSV text by replacing 1-byte characters
specified in a lookup table with a string. The lookup table is in the
configuration file dublin_core_value_cleanup.yaml.

v0.2
----
- Update data in dublin_core_value_cleanup.yaml
- Allow the DSpace Simple Archive Format item-directory to contain an
  arbitrarily large number of items.
- Add the constant, VERBOSE. If true, the script displays all metadata text
  and shows if any characters are changed via the cleanup process.
- Issue a warning if a single or odd number of '|' are used as this might
  represent a mistyped value separator '||'.
- Issue a warning if filenames referenced more than once.
- Issue an error if any header fields are empty.

v0.3
----
- Improve logging (in VERBOSE mode) to assist character cleanup including
  the detection of illegal HTML4 codes.
- Added new/improved cleanup mode "fromLookup_toLookupStringWithHtmlCode".
  This is the new default cleanup mode. This mode will:
  * substitute any 1-byte character with its associated string from
    the lookup table, otherwise;
  * substitute any 1-byte character with its associated HTML code
    (ie. "&#xNN;") if the byte is 0x80-0xff, otherwise;
  * use the raw character.

v1.0
----
- Document conversion of CSV file to UTF-8 (ie. the preferred cleanup method)
- Changed the default cleanup_mode to 'none'
- Show all the missing files (referenced in the CSV) before quitting
