FlindersDSpace-csv4itemimport
=============================

v0.1
----
Initial version. Is able to "clean" CSV text by replacing 1-byte characters
specified in a lookup table with a string. The lookup table is in the
configuration file dublin_core_value_cleanup.yaml.

v0.2
----
- Update data in dublin_core_value_cleanup.yaml
- Allow the DSpace Simple Archive Format item-directory to contain an
  arbitrarily large number of items.
- Add the constant, VERBOSE. If true, the script displays all metadata text
  and shows if any characters are changed via the cleanup process.
- Issue a warning if a single or odd number of '|' are used as this might
  represent a mistyped value separator '||'.
- Issue a warning if filenames referenced more than once.
- Issue an error if any header fields are empty.

v0.3
----
- Improve logging (in VERBOSE mode) to assist character cleanup including
  the detection of illegal HTML4 codes.
- Added new/improved cleanup mode fromLookup_toLookupStringWithHtmlCode.
  This mode will apply 1-byte character substitutions from the lookup
  table first, otherwise apply substitutions with HTML code equivalents
  if the 1-byte character is 0x80-0xff, otherwise use the raw character.
  This is the new default cleanup mode.
